# ITRI_616_Project

# Telco Customer Churn Prediction

This repository contains the full implementation of a machine learning classification project for the **ITRI616 – Artificial Intelligence 1** module at North-West University. The objective is to predict whether a customer will churn based on their demographic, billing, and service usage information.
